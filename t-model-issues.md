This automatically-generated file contains references from the [main union bibliography](README.md) that have been filtered for a single tag.  Do not edit this file; instead, please update the main bibliography and tag references appropriately to have them show up here.  Thank you!

The papers are listed in the same order as the main bibliography; e.g., by year of publication / release; then by surname / name of the first author.
